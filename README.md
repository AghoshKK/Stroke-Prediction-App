# 🧠 Stroke Prediction App

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke based on basic medical and demographic factors like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle habits.

Built using **Python**, **Flask**, and **scikit-learn**, the app exposes a REST API that accepts user data and returns stroke risk as a percentage.
